Note:  
Only tested locally.  
If you want to delete tmp files you need to give www-data delete permission  
	and uncomment the following line in DB.php  
	```
	 //unlink($f);//www-data needs delete permission !  
	```  
	also you can uncomment the following line in the same file for extra security:  
	```
	//chmod($file, 0600);  
	```

Feel free to play with this mini project.
